## Capability Overview

### Multi-Format Binary Support

Arkana automatically detects and analyses binaries across all major platforms:

- **PE (Windows)**  - Full parsing of DOS/NT Headers, Imports/Exports, Resources, TLS, Debug, Load Config, Rich Header, Overlay, and more.

Only registered when binary-refinery is installed.

### Session Continuity & AI Progress Tracking

Arkana is designed for **large binary corpus analysis** where AI clients need to maintain analytical context across long investigations and limited context windows:

- **Persistent Notes**  - Record findings with `add_note()`, auto-summarise functions with `auto_note_function()`, and aggregate everything with `get_analysis_digest()`. Notes survive server restarts and are restored automatically when the same file is reopened.
- **Tool History**  - Every tool invocation is recorded with parameters, result summaries, and timing. Use `get_tool_history()` to review what was done, or `get_session_summary()` for full session state.
- **Cross-Session Restoration**  - When a previously analysed file is reopened, `open_file` returns a `session_context` field containing restored notes and prior tool history, enabling the AI to resume where it left off.
- **Analysis Digest**  - `get_analysis_digest()` compiles all accumulated notes, triage findings, IOCs, coverage stats, and unexplored targets into a single context-efficient summary  - what was *learned*, not just what tools ran.
- **Discoverability**  - `list_tools_by_phase()` organises tools by workflow stage, `suggest_next_action()` recommends specific next steps based on session state, and `get_analysis_timeline()` merges tool history with notes into a chronological narrative.
- **Workflow Automation**  - `generate_analysis_report()` produces a comprehensive Markdown report from accumulated findings, and `auto_name_sample()` suggests descriptive filenames based on detected capabilities and C2 indicators.
- **Project Export/Import**  - Bundle analysis + notes + history + binary into a `.arkana_project.tar.gz` for sharing or archiving with `export_project`.

### Dynamic File Loading & Caching

- **Auto-Detection**  - `open_file` automatically detects PE/ELF/Mach-O from magic bytes. Unknown formats (ZIP, PDF, PCAP, DEX, etc.) are identified and fall back to raw/shellcode mode instead of crashing in PE mode. Use `force=True` to override.
- **Pre-Parse Integrity Checks**  - Every `open_file` call includes a `file_integrity` assessment in the response: status (healthy/suspicious/partial/corrupt), issues list, flags, format details, and recommendation. The standalone `check_file_integrity` tool can run before loading. Flagged files automatically use a reduced analysis timeout to prevent hangs.
- **No Pre-loading Required**  - The MCP server starts without needing a file path. Use the `open_file` tool to load files dynamically.
- **Analysis Caching**  - Results are cached to disk in `~/.arkana/cache/`, keyed by SHA256 hash and compressed with gzip (~12x compression). Re-opening a previously analysed file loads instantly from cache.
- **Persistent Configuration**  - API keys are stored securely in `~/.arkana/config.json` and recalled automatically across sessions.
- **Progress Reporting**  - Over 50 long-running tools report fine-grained progress to the MCP client in real time (percentage, stage descriptions). Tools running in background threads use a thread-safe `ProgressBridge` to push updates back to the async MCP context.
- **Progress-Adaptive Background Timeouts**  - Background tasks use a soft timeout → OVERTIME → stall-kill system. After the soft timeout (5 min for generic tasks, 15 min for CFG), the task enters `overtime` status (still running). During overtime, progress is checked every 60s — if progressing, the task keeps running; if stalled for 5 min with zero progress, it is killed. A 6-hour absolute ceiling prevents pathological cases. Passive `_background_alerts` are injected into every tool response when tasks are in overtime. Use `abort_background_task(task_id)` to explicitly stop any task. Eight tools capture partial results on stall-kill. All timeout values are configurable via environment variables.

| `emulate_shellcode_with_qiling` | Multi-architecture shellcode emulation (x86, x64, ARM, ARM64, MIPS) with API/syscall capture. Paginated (default limit 20). |
| `qiling_trace_execution` | Instruction-level execution tracing with addresses, sizes, and raw bytes for each executed instruction. Paginated (default limit 50). |
| `qiling_hook_api_calls` | Hook specific APIs/syscalls to capture arguments and return values during emulation. Paginated (default limit 20). |
| `qiling_dump_unpacked_binary` | Dynamic unpacking via emulation — handles custom/unknown packers that YARA-based unipacker cannot identify. `smart_unpack` (default True) hooks VirtualAlloc/VirtualAllocEx to track allocations, then scans for PE headers (MZ + PE signature) in tracked regions. Falls back to largest-region heuristic if no PE found. |
| `qiling_resolve_api_hashes` | Resolve API hash values (ROR13, CRC32, DJB2, FNV-1a) against known DLL exports. |

> **Note:** Qiling runs in an isolated venv (`/app/qiling-venv`) with unicorn 1.x, keeping the main environment's unicorn 2.x intact for angr. Linux rootfs is pre-populated at Docker build time. Windows PE emulation requires real DLL files copied from a Windows installation  - see [QILING_ROOTFS.md](QILING_ROOTFS.md) for setup instructions. Registry hive stubs are auto-generated at runtime.

## Interactive Emulation Debugger (29 tools)

Interactive debugger built on Qiling, providing step-by-step emulation control with breakpoints, watchpoints, memory inspection, and snapshot-based state management. Unlike fire-and-forget emulation tools, debug sessions persist across MCP calls via a JSONL protocol over a persistent subprocess.

### Session Lifecycle

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_start` | Start an interactive debug session on the loaded binary. Spawns a persistent Qiling subprocess, pauses at entry point. `stub_crt` (default True) installs ~47 CRT initialization stubs (GetSystemTimeAsFileTime, GetCurrentProcessId, GetProcessHeap, critical sections, TLS/FLS, etc.). `stub_io` (default True) installs Win32 console API stubs to prevent crashes from printf/cout/cin. API tracing is enabled by default. Returns initial PC, registers, architecture, and stub/trace status. Max 3 concurrent sessions. |
| `debug_stop` | Stop and destroy a debug session. Kills the subprocess and frees resources. |
| `debug_status` | Check if a debug session is alive and return its current state (PC, status, instructions executed, architecture). |

### Execution Control

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_step` | Step N instructions (default 1). Returns updated PC, registers, and next 5 disassembled instructions. |
| `debug_step_over` | Step over a CALL instruction (sets temporary breakpoint after the call). If the current instruction is not a CALL, behaves like single step. |
| `debug_continue` | Continue execution until a breakpoint/watchpoint is hit, the program exits, or `max_instructions` (default 10M) is reached. |
| `debug_run_until` | Run until a specific address is reached (temporary breakpoint). Accepts `max_instructions` safety limit. |

### Breakpoints & Watchpoints

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_set_breakpoint` | Set a breakpoint by address, API name, or with conditions (e.g., `{"register": "eax", "equals": "0x0"}`). Max 100 per session. |
| `debug_remove_breakpoint` | Remove a breakpoint by ID. |
| `debug_set_watchpoint` | Set a memory watchpoint (read, write, or both) on an address range. Max 50 per session, max 1MB region. |
| `debug_remove_watchpoint` | Remove a watchpoint by ID. |
| `debug_list_breakpoints` | List all breakpoints and watchpoints in the session. |

### Inspection & Modification

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_read_state` | Read full execution state: all registers, flags, PC, stack top, next 5 disassembled instructions, and memory map summary. |
| `debug_read_memory` | Read N bytes at an address. Returns hex dump and optional capstone disassembly. Max 1MB per read. |
| `debug_write_memory` | Write bytes to memory at a given address. |
| `debug_write_register` | Set a register value. Validates register name against the session's architecture. |

### Snapshots

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_snapshot_save` | Save complete emulation state (CPU, memory, hooks) with an optional name and note. Max 10 per session. |
| `debug_snapshot_restore` | Restore a previously saved snapshot, rewinding execution to that point. |
| `debug_snapshot_list` | List all saved snapshots with metadata (PC, instruction count, timestamp). |
| `debug_snapshot_diff` | Compare two snapshots — shows register differences and changed memory regions. With `attribute_changes=True`, correlates memory changes with API calls that occurred between snapshots (VirtualAlloc, WriteProcessMemory, ReadFile, VirtualProtect categories) and reports unattributed changes. |

### I/O Stubs

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_set_input` | Queue input data for stubbed console input (ReadConsoleA). Supports UTF-8 and hex encoding. Queue input before stepping through stdin/cin/scanf code. |
| `debug_get_output` | Retrieve captured console output from I/O stubs. All text from WriteConsoleA/W (printf, puts, cout) is captured. Paginated with optional clear. |

### API Call Tracing

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_get_api_trace` | Retrieve the API call trace log. All Windows API calls are logged with function name, arguments, and return value. Paginated with optional name filter. Supports structured `query` predicates for filtering by argument values, return values, and sequence numbers (e.g. `api=VirtualAlloc,args.p3=0x40`). Operators: `=`, `!=`, `~` (substring), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`. Also supports ordered `sequence` matching to find API call patterns (e.g. `VirtualAlloc;WriteProcessMemory;CreateRemoteThread`). |
| `debug_clear_api_trace` | Clear the API call trace buffer. |
| `debug_set_trace_filter` | Configure API trace filtering. Set a whitelist of specific API names, or enable/disable tracing entirely. |

### Memory Search

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_search_memory` | Search all mapped memory for string patterns (UTF-8 + UTF-16LE) or hex byte patterns with `??` wildcards. Returns matches with address, region label, and context bytes. Max 100 matches. |

### API Stubs

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `debug_stub_api` | Create a custom API stub at runtime. When the binary calls the specified Windows API, the stub intercepts it, sets the return value, optionally writes data to output pointer parameters, and returns cleanly. `set_last_error` parameter bypasses GetLastError() anti-emulation techniques (e.g. `set_last_error="0x578"` for ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE). Useful for stubbing APIs not covered by builtin CRT/I/O stubs. Max 200 user stubs. |
| `debug_list_stubs` | List all installed API stubs: builtin I/O stubs (8 console APIs), builtin CRT stubs (~47 MSVC init APIs), and user-defined stubs. |
| `debug_remove_stub` | Remove a user-defined API stub. Builtin I/O and CRT stubs cannot be removed — restart the session with `stub_io=False` or `stub_crt=False` to disable them. |

> **Note:** Debug sessions use the same isolated Qiling venv (`/app/qiling-venv`) as the fire-and-forget emulation tools. Sessions time out after 30 minutes of inactivity (`ARKANA_DEBUG_SESSION_TTL`). Each execution command has a 5-minute timeout (`ARKANA_DEBUG_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`). When the timeout fires, the session is **paused, not killed** — the runner calls `emu_stop()` (Unicorn's thread-safe stop) to halt emulation while preserving all CPU state, memory, and hooks. You can inspect the paused session with `debug_read_state`/`debug_read_memory`/`debug_search_memory`, then resume with `debug_continue`. Emulation fidelity limitations apply — complex anti-emulation, threading, and some Windows APIs may not work correctly.

## Post-Emulation Memory Inspection (8 tools)

Persistent emulation sessions that keep the Qiling or Speakeasy subprocess alive after `run()` completes. Unlike fire-and-forget emulation tools, these allow unlimited memory queries on the same emulation state without re-running the binary.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `emulate_and_inspect` | Emulate a binary or shellcode with Qiling or Speakeasy, keep the session alive. Returns behavioral report + `session_id` for subsequent memory queries. |
| `emulation_resume` | Resume emulation from where it left off (Qiling only). Continues from current CPU state with a fresh timeout. Enables staged long-running operations like UPX decompression: run 300s → check memory → resume 300s → check → repeat. |
| `emulation_read_memory` | Read raw bytes at a virtual address (max 1MB). Supports `format="disasm"` for Capstone disassembly. |
| `emulation_write_memory` | Write bytes to memory at a virtual address. Useful for patching code or modifying data. |
| `emulation_search_memory` | Search all mapped memory regions for string (UTF-8 + UTF-16LE) or hex patterns. |
| `emulation_memory_map` | List all mapped memory regions with addresses, sizes, permissions, and labels. |
| `emulation_session_status` | List all active emulation inspect sessions with metadata. |
| `close_emulation_session` | Close an emulation session and release subprocess resources. |

> **Note:** Max 3 concurrent emulation sessions (`ARKANA_MAX_EMULATION_SESSIONS`). Sessions idle for 30 minutes are automatically cleaned up (`ARKANA_EMULATION_SESSION_TTL`). Emulation uses the same isolated venvs as fire-and-forget tools (Qiling venv for Qiling, Speakeasy venv for Speakeasy). Defense-in-depth timeouts: runner hard timer (`os._exit` at timeout+15s), MCP `threading.Timer` backup (kills subprocess at timeout+45s), `asyncio.wait_for` (timeout+30s). User's `timeout_seconds` is propagated to all layers.

## Binary Refinery  - Data Transforms (23 tools)

Arkana integrates the full power of [Binary Refinery](https://github.com/binref/refinery)  - a library of **200+ composable binary transformation units**  - through 23 context-efficient MCP tools. Binary Refinery is used extensively by professional malware analysts for tasks like decrypting multi-layer obfuscation, extracting payloads from documents, unpacking installers, and parsing forensic artefacts. Arkana makes these capabilities accessible through natural language, with the AI selecting the right units automatically.

All tools accept data as hex input or operate on the currently loaded file. All Refinery tools support pagination via `limit` (default 20) and `offset` (default 0) parameters. **Only registered when binary-refinery is installed** (lazy registration saves context tokens when absent).

> **Context efficiency:** 56 individual tools were consolidated into 23 using the dispatch pattern (`operation=...` parameter), saving ~33 tool definitions (~15-20K tokens) from the MCP catalogue.

| `get_analysis_timeline()` | **Investigation narrative**  - merges tool history with notes into a single chronological timeline showing the full analysis story. Paginated (default limit 20). |

### Recommended AI Workflow

1. **`get_config()`**  - discover writable paths, container environment, and available libraries
2. **`open_file(path)`**  - load binary, auto-starts background angr CFG. If `session_context` is present, call `get_analysis_digest()` first to review previous findings. All background tasks (CFG build, symbolic execution, data flow, emulation) have automatic timeouts and stall detection  - use `check_task_status(task_id)` to monitor elapsed time and progress.
3. **`get_triage_report(compact=True)`**  - initial risk assessment in ~2KB. **Key findings are auto-saved as notes.**
4. **`get_focused_imports()`**  - understand what suspicious APIs are imported
5. **`get_strings_summary()`**  - categorised string overview
6. **`get_function_map()`**  - find the most interesting functions to investigate (default limit 30; use `limit` and `offset` to page through results)
7. **`decompile_function_with_angr(address)`**  - deep-dive into each target
8. **`auto_note_function(address)`**  - **ALWAYS call after each decompilation** to record what you learned
9. **`add_note(content, category='tool_result')`**  - record any important manual findings (decoded IOCs, anti-debug tricks, etc.)
10. **`get_analysis_digest()`**  - call at phase transitions to refresh your understanding

> **Pagination tip:** Most tools default to returning 20 items per page. If results indicate `"has_more": true` in the `_pagination` block, call the same tool with an incremented `offset` to fetch the next page.

## Session Persistence & Notes

Notes and tool history are the primary mechanism for preserving analysis context across sessions and managing long-running investigations within limited context windows. All notes and history persist to disk automatically.

**How notes work:**
- **Automatic**: `get_triage_report()` auto-saves risk assessment, critical imports, and IOCs as `tool_result` notes
- **Function summaries**: `auto_note_function(address)` generates and saves one-line behavioural summaries from API patterns  - call this after every decompilation
- **Manual findings**: `add_note(content, category='tool_result')` records specific observations (decoded C2 URLs, crypto keys, evasion techniques)
- **Aggregation**: `get_analysis_digest()` compiles all notes into an actionable summary with coverage stats and unexplored targets
- **Persistence**: Notes survive server restarts. When the same file is reopened, all previous notes and history are restored automatically
- **Export**: `export_project` bundles analysis + notes + history + artifacts + optionally the binary into a `.arkana_project.tar.gz` for sharing

**Note categories:** `general`, `function`, `tool_result`, `ioc`, `hypothesis`, `manual`

**Artifacts:** Tools that extract files (unpacking, payload carving, config extraction) register them via `state.register_artifact()`. Artifacts are tracked with path, SHA256 hash, source tool, and type detection. They persist via cache alongside notes and are included in `export_project` / `import_project` archives. Limits: `MAX_ARTIFACT_FILE_SIZE` (100 MB per file), `MAX_TOTAL_ARTIFACT_EXPORT_SIZE` (50 MB total export).

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `add_note` | Record a finding or observation. Categories: `general`, `function`, `tool_result`, `ioc`, `hypothesis`, `manual`. Persisted to disk cache, survives restarts. |

## Rename / Annotation Layer (6 tools)

Persistent function renames, variable renames, and address labels. Renames are automatically applied to decompilation and disassembly output. Persisted via cache alongside notes  - restored when the same binary is reopened.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `rename_function` | Assign a user-defined name to a function at a given address. The name is applied in `decompile_function_with_angr`, `batch_decompile`, and `get_function_map` output. |
| `rename_variable` | Rename a variable within a function scope. Applied in decompilation output for that function. |
| `add_label` | Add a labelled marker at a given address with a category (`general`, `ioc`, `crypto`, `c2`, `function`). Labels appear in `get_annotated_disassembly` output. |
| `list_renames` | List all renames and labels, optionally filtered by type (`functions`, `variables`, `labels`). |
| `delete_rename` | Remove a specific rename or label by address and type. |
| `batch_rename` | Bulk apply up to 50 renames/labels in a single call. Accepts a list of `{type, address, name, ...}` dicts. |

## Custom Types (5 tools)

User-defined structs and enums for parsing binary data. Struct field types reuse `parse_binary_struct` types (uint8-64 LE/BE, cstring, wstring, ipv4, bytes:N, padding:N). Persisted via cache.

**Validation guards:** Field names must match `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. Enum values are checked against the declared byte size with duplicate detection. Cycle detection prevents recursive struct references. Padding bounds are 0–10 MB. Cstrings are decoded as UTF-8 with Latin-1 fallback.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_struct` | Define a named struct with typed fields. Validates field types against the `parse_binary_struct` schema. |
| `create_enum` | Define a named enum with name-to-integer mappings and a byte size. |
| `apply_type_at_offset` | Parse binary data at a file offset using a previously defined custom type. Supports parsing multiple consecutive instances via `count` parameter (max 100). |

## Frida Script Generation (3 tools)

Generate ready-to-run Frida JavaScript instrumentation scripts from static analysis findings. No Frida dependency  - generates standalone `.js` code that can be used with `frida -l`.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `generate_frida_hook_script` | Generate a Frida hook script for specified API functions or hex addresses (up to 50 targets). Produces code that intercepts API calls, logs arguments/return values with type-aware formatting for 50+ common APIs, and captures backtraces. |
| `generate_frida_bypass_script` | Generate a Frida script that bypasses anti-debug techniques. Auto-detects anti-debug APIs from the binary's imports/triage data and generates targeted bypass code (IsDebuggerPresent, NtQueryInformationProcess, timing checks, PEB patches, etc.). |
| `generate_frida_trace_script` | Generate a Frida API tracing script based on the binary's import table. Identifies suspicious/interesting APIs and creates a comprehensive tracing script filterable by category (networking, crypto, injection, file_io, registry, etc.). |

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `scan_for_vulnerability_patterns` | Scan decompiled functions for 11 common vulnerability patterns: buffer overflows, format strings, command injection, memory corruption, integer overflows, path traversal, insecure crypto, hardcoded credentials, race conditions, DLL hijacking, and double-free. Filterable by severity and function address. |
| `assess_function_attack_surface` | Assess the attack surface of a specific function by analysing input sources, dangerous sinks, source-to-sink connectivity, reachability (caller count), and complexity. Produces a risk score from 0 to 100. |
| `find_dangerous_data_flows` | Trace data flow from input sources (recv, read, scanf, argv, etc.) to dangerous sinks (system, strcpy, sprintf, memcpy, WinExec, etc.) within individual functions. Uses RDA with structural fallback. For inter-procedural flows, use `trace_taint_flows`. |
| `trace_taint_flows` | Inter-procedural taint flow analysis — traces data from untrusted input sources (network, file, environment, registry, user input) to dangerous sinks (buffer copy, command execution, format strings, data exfiltration) across function call-chain boundaries. Three-phase analysis: structural BFS through the call graph, decompile-based argument flow validation, and optional per-function RDA for high-confidence results. Supports source/sink category filtering and automatic reverse tracing when targeting a sink function. |

## .NET Deobfuscation & Decompilation (3 tools)

## Known Tool Limitations

The following limitations have been identified through comprehensive testing. They are inherent to the underlying analysis frameworks or architectural constraints.

### Data Flow & Slicing

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| `get_data_dependencies` | Returns raw angr internal representations (`SimEngineRDVEX`, `LocalVariableTag` atoms). Output is useful for programmatic analysis but not human-readable summaries. Prefer `get_reaching_definitions` or `propagate_constants` for more interpretable results. |
| `get_backward_slice` / `get_forward_slice` | Returns CFG reachability (all blocks that *can* reach or *be reached from* a target), not true data-flow slices. The `variable` parameter selects the starting point but the slice follows control flow, not data dependencies. |
| `extract_function_constants` | Includes code addresses (call targets, branch destinations) alongside actual data constants. Filter by checking whether values fall within code section ranges. |

### Emulation & Unpacking

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| Qiling tools (`emulate_binary_with_qiling`, etc.) | Requires manual rootfs setup with real Windows DLLs. Use `qiling_setup_check()` to verify. See [QILING_ROOTFS.md](QILING_ROOTFS.md) for setup. |
| `auto_unpack_pe` / `try_all_unpackers` | FSG-packed binaries may fail to unpack with Unipacker. Use Qiling-based unpacking (`qiling_dump_unpacked_binary`) or manual OEP recovery as fallback. |
| Speakeasy / Qiling emulation | Complex packers with anti-emulation checks may cause emulation to stall or produce incomplete results. Timeouts and partial results are captured automatically. |
| Debug sessions (`debug_*` tools) | Emulation fidelity limitations apply  - anti-emulation techniques, threading, and complex Windows APIs may produce incorrect results or cause the session to stall. Watchpoints add per-instruction overhead. Snapshots (`ql.save()`/`ql.restore()`) may not fully capture complex hook or callback state. Max 3 concurrent sessions, 30-minute idle timeout. |

### External Dependencies

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| `get_virustotal_report_for_loaded_file` | Requires a VirusTotal API key. Configure with `set_api_key(key_name="vt_api_key", key_value="...")`. |
| `scan_for_embedded_files` | Requires binwalk v3+. Uses `--signature --quiet` flags for structured output. |

### Output & Response Limits

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| `analyze_batch` | The 8KB MCP response soft limit can truncate comparison data for large file sets. Use smaller `file_paths` lists (5-10 files) or filter by specific metrics. |
| `search_decompiled_code` | Searches angr-decompiled C pseudocode, not assembly mnemonics. For assembly-level search, use `get_annotated_disassembly(search="pattern")` on specific functions. |
| `refinery_list_units` | Returns a simplified category-level view of Binary Refinery's unit tree. Individual unit parameters are not listed — refer to Binary Refinery's documentation for detailed unit options. |

### Analysis Quality

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| `refinery_carve` / `refinery_extract_iocs` | May produce false positives when run on raw binary data (e.g. detecting Base64 patterns in code sections). Validate extracted IOCs against context. |
| `get_calling_conventions` | May return no results for simprocedures, library stubs, or very small functions. A diagnostic note is included when this occurs. |
| `get_dominators` | Returns empty results when the target address is the function entry point or doesn't correspond to a basic block boundary. Diagnostic notes explain the cause. |
